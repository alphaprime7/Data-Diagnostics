# Data-Diagnostics
This is a data diagnostic project provided by the professor on bird data that was supposedly DOD data received from a consultant friend.
The variable fledgling tarsus size was recorded for Black-Capped Vireo birds on Fort Hood as a means of assessing the effects of bombing test range on fledgling success. The data was presented to our environmental consulting firm by the Department of Defense.
